# INDUSINDBK-Stock-Price-Prediction-using-GRU
This project builds a GRU-based deep learning model to predict the stock price of INDUSINDBK. It uses moving average and exponential moving average as features, applies MinMax scaling, and trains a GRU model using Keras. The model is evaluated using RMSE and MAE, and results are visualized by comparing predicted vs actual stock prices.
